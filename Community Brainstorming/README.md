The Hydro Community is a place for the community to propose and discuss ideas for the HCDP, with a view to refining them before they are submitted to the official HCDP.

The Hydro Community GitHub can be found at https://github.com/HydroCommunity

Head over to the Hydrogen HCDP wiki for more details on the official submission and development process.
